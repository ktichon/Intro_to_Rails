<h2>Welcome to the Dungon Creater</h2>
<p>This is a website used to create and store randomly generated dungeons for your next dnd campagin.
Using a frankly baffling collection of spaghetti code and CSS, I was able to create a program that will fill any fantasy mountain side or sunken castle with a maze of passage ways and chambers.</p>
<h3>Data Sources used in project</h3>
<p>Most of the information used in this Project is from the 5e Dungeons Masters Guide by Wizards of the Coast. There are 3 data sets used in this project. The first data sets I used are 3 CSV files containing info directly copied from the book, getting a list of locations, events, and flavorful detail for the dungeon. The second Data set is Faker, which I used to generate ‘creative’ names for the dungeons.  The last Data set was a program of my own creation, that will generate the x/y values of all the interlocking rooms in the dungeon, populating my rooms table.</p>
